# Offline Support

The application implements offline support through the following mechanisms:

## Message Queue
- Messages are stored locally when offline
- Automatic synchronization when connection is restored
- Conflict resolution for concurrent updates

## Usage
```typescript
// Store message for offline use
await offlineStorage.storeMessage(message);

// Sync pending messages
await offlineStorage.syncMessages();
```

## Error Handling
- Failed synchronization attempts are retried
- Messages remain in queue until successfully sent
